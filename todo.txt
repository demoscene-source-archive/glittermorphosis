* compress the code shared by the star and heart, maybe the other shapes
* put all this stuff into a codeblocks project for faster design iteration and performance measurements
* fix the shader minifier or figure out another way to comply with the spec for seperable program interfaces

like a rollercoaster



* maybe push the star further away
* add something to push home the idea that the fountain is on a surface (some adjustment to shading of the particles which are below the floor, to make the appearance of a tiled floor)


-- done --
* add a subtle camera wobble / sway (like hand-held) to the fountain part
* make the fountain part focus-in
* make the remaining stars at the end behind the heart slow down to a stop. must be fully stopped by the time they dominate the view.
* create the ringed planet
* create the galaxy
* make the post-processes run faster
* add the current frame index to the RNG seed
* make the front bokeh centerpoint glow more pronounced
* fix the star shape so it doesn't have a super-bright center
* fix discontinuities in particle motion resulting in big streaks of motion
